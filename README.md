# Phytoplankton Image Classification

Classification of phytoplankton images taken through flow cams using ML techniques


## High level goals

- Extract images, data wrangling, etc.
- Design an image recognition, convolutional neural network.
- Train the CNN, test the output. (Lots of number crunching.)
- Tweak the CNN architecture/structure, hyperparameters, etc.
- Repeat CNN design, training, and testing until we feel that it's "good enough".
- Hopefully publish.
